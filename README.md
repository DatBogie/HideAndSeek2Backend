Hide & Seek 2 is the sequel to a Minecraft world some of my friends and I played on. We downloaded a large room map from online, then made our own modifications to turn it into a fun hide-and-seek game that we played religiously for a little while.

That world's hide-and-seek system was hackily cobbled together with a bunch of command blocksâ€”this one has been hackily-ish developed with a datapack. This is said datapack. It o nly works properly on the world linked in the note above.
